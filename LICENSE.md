The Imprimis engine is blanket licenced under the zlib license where no other
license is explicitly mentioned (e.g. fonts under the Open Font License). The
source code of the engine itself is entirely covered by this license. All parts
of the game are open-source licenced.

In particular, visual assets are licensed under Creative Commons licenses,
though all assets used in the game are CC-BY-SA or less restrictive.
